  abstract = {"Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout."--Publisher description.},

  abstract = {A sample size calculation for logistic regression involves complicated formulae. This paper suggests use of sample size formulae for comparing means or for comparing proportions in order to calculate the required sample size for a simple logistic regression model. One can then adjust the required sample size for a multiple logistic regression model by a variance inflation factor. This method requires no assumption of low response probability in the logistic model as in a previous publication. One can similarly calculate the sample size for linear regression models. This paper also compares the accuracy of some existing sample-size software for logistic regression with computer power simulations. An example illustrates the methods. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
